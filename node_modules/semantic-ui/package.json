Join the discussion on their respective boards.\n* **Want to help others learn concepts behind Semantic?** [Learnsemantic.com](http://www.learnsemantic.com) needs articles to help others get others up to speed with Semantic UI. [Send me an e-mail](mailto:jack@semantic-ui.com) if you are interested.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Basic Usage (Default Theme)\n\nWe recommend setting up the Semantic build workflow to support on-the-fly\ntheming and customization, but it is not required.\n\nTo use the \"ready-to-use\" distribution version, which includes all components, simply link to\n`dist/semantic.js` and `dist/semantic.css` (or their minified counterparts) in your page.\n\n``` html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/dist/semantic.min.css\">\n<script src=\"/dist/semantic.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou may also prefer to use individual components found in `dist/components` to reduce the libraries file size.\n\n``` html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/dist/components/icon.css\">\n```\n\n\n### Recommended Usage (Themed)\n\nSemantic is best used actively during development. We have included build tools for updating your site's theme as you work.\n\n![Getting Started](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657007/install.gif)\n\n```\nnpm install\ngulp\n```\n\nRunning gulp for the first time will start the interactive set-up.\n\nThis helps you create two important files ``semantic.json`` which stores your folder set-up, and ``themes.config`` a central file for setting ui themes.\n\nThe install utility will also help you set-up which components you want to include in your packaged release, ignoring parts of Semantic you may not use.\n\nOnce set-up you can use these commands to maintain your project\n```nodejs\ngulp  // defaults to watch after install\ngulp build // build all files from source\ngulp clean // clears your dist folder\ngulp watch // watch files\ngulp install // re-runs install\ngulp help // list all commands\n```\n\nFor more detail into how work with Semantic when building a site please [read out customization guide](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html) on [LearnSemantic.com](http://learnsemantic.com/)\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\n* Last 2 Versions FF, Chrome, IE (aka 10+)\n* Safari 6\n* IE 9+ (Browser prefix only)\n* Android 4\n* Blackberry 10\n\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nWhen adding pull requests be sure to merge into [next](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/next) branch. If you need to demonstrate a fix in ``next`` release, you can use [this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/rduvhn8u/1/)\n\n## Reaching Out\n\nIf you'd like to start a conversation about Semantic feel free to reach out by e-mail [jack@semantic-ui.com](mailto:jack@semantic-ui.com)\n\n[![Flattr This](https://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=jlukic&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjlukic%2FSemantic-UI)\n\n",
